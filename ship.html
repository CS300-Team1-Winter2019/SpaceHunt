#this is a basic example of how I'd like to code ship movement. It obviously doesn't work right now.
#I need to figure out how Illia is going to want to have the map object check the destination square
#the ship wants to land on, and what the return values could look like.

#i think we'll need a few user-defined data types here. I'll just list my immediate thoughts here:
#	polar_coordinates: a tuple consisting of an angle and a scalar length (30 degrees, 5 units)
#	game_square: probably just a cartesian coordinate point identifying the specific square the ship
#				will land on, with values that can be used as indices in the 2d array that composes the map.
#				example: (64, 32)
#	some_complex_data_type: so this one is more confusing. the way this currently works in my head is that
#	the Map object will be able to communicate a number of different possible messages to the Ship class, based
#	on the square that the ship has decided it wants to land on. I currently see the following options:
#	1) There is nothing occupying the square, in which case the Map will update the ship's location, the ship
#		will update its own location, and this gameplay loop will exit
#	2) there is a celestial object (planet, asteroid, etc) on the square, and the ship crashes and game ends.
#	3) there is a wormhole on the square. this is the most complicated case, because the Map will need to return
#		a few things:
#			a) the location (game_square data type) where the ship encountered the wormhole
#						(so the ship can calculate how much of its original move it still has to execute after its wormhole jump)
#			b) the location (game_square data type) that the wormhole will teleport the ship to.
#	4) BadMax's ship is on the square we've warped to, and we need to do a dice-roll
#	5) i'm sure there are other things. abandoned ships, etc. i dont' think we have to deal with them now.
#
#	this means that some_complex_data_type is really complicated. since it has to store a bunch of different information.
#	there's probably a better way to do this with dynamic binding? or maybe the control structure could be simpler.


#	current iussues I see here from my end are:
#		defining these data types in a way that makes sense to everybody in the group, and will work with all our features
#		the function (here called map.check_destination_square) will be pretty complex. i'm definitely not sure that the way
#			I've thought of doing this is the best one. So if anyone has an idea they think is better, i'm all ears
#		need to figure out a way to code this (recursively?) so that the ship can handle multiple wormhole interactions in a single jump.


#i've changed this stuff around a little bit and added Ship.js. I have no idea what i'm doing in javascript.
#gonna go watch some youtube tutorials. at this point neither ship nor map is a class, which we will definitely have to change!
